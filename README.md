# Classifying Tumors In MRI Scans

## Repository Contents
This repository contains all of the necessary files and scripts for classifying 3 types of tumors from 3064 MRI scans. The analysis aims to determine whether different modeling techniques, CNN and SVM , can result in a highly accurate classification.

## 1. Software and Platform

### Programming Languages and Software
- **MATLAB**: For converting the .mat files into .jpg images for analysis.
- **Python**: For running the machine learning models with the .jpg images. 

### Python Packages
- `tensorflow` â€“ building the CNN model
- `keras` â€“ calling specific functions to modify the layers and build CNN model
- `sklearn` â€“ splitting the data into training and testing, building the SVM model
- `tqdm` â€“ loading in the image data
- `cv2` â€“ loading in the image data
- `os` â€“ loading in the image data from a specific file path
- `io` â€“ loading in the image data
- `pandas` â€“ cleaning the image data labels and predicted values
- `numpy` â€“ cleaning the image data labels and predicted values
- `seaborn` â€“ used to visualize the data for the exploratory data analysis
- `matplotlib` â€“ used to visualize the data for the exploratory data analysis and measuring performance metrics
- `random` â€“ randomize which rows are selected when balancing the data set

### Platform Compatibility
Developed and tested on Mac, but should work on Windows and Linux with appropriate installations.

## 3. Instructions for Reproducing Results

### Stage 1: Image Conversion in MATLAB
- Before you start, it is recommended that you make two subfolders in your  `data/` directory called `MAT Images` and `JPG Images` (or some variant of these names) for easier data handling.
- Download the Brain Tumor Data Set from the [Figshare website](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).
- Extract the image .zip files and place them in your `data/MAT Images` directory. These files will typically be named â€˜brainTumorDataPublic_1-766-[date downloaded].zipâ€™ (where 1-766 represents the image numbers; in total, there will be 4 folders and 3064 images in total after extraction). 
- Run `01_MATLAB_mat_to_jpg_conversion.m` in MATLAB to do the following:
  - Locate the â€˜input_folderâ€™ variable (located in line 15) and replace the '**your input folder here**' with the filepath of your downloaded folder. This will be one of the four folders in the `data/MAT Images`.  
  - On the following line (line 16), find the â€˜output_folderâ€™ variable and replace the '**your output folder here**â€™ with the filepath of your .jpg images, called `data/JPG Images` in this case.
  - Run this code three more times, each time replacing the â€˜input_folderâ€™ variable with the filepath of the next folder in your `data/MAT Images` directory. 
- By the end of this process, your `JPG Images` folder should contain three subfolders: â€˜1,â€™ â€˜2,â€™ and â€˜3.â€™ This is because the code classifies the images into the three tumors: â€˜1â€™ corresponds to the meningioma tumor, â€˜2â€™ corresponds to the glioma tumor, and â€˜3â€™ corresponds to the pituitary tumor. 
- Rename the numbered folders to the corresponding tumors so that the Python analysis in the next step runs smoothly. 

### Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Open up JupyterLab to run `02_brain_tumor_classification.ipynb`
- You may need to use the following commands in the JupyterLab Terminal to install the appropriate packages (if you donâ€™t have them already):
  ```pycon
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install keras
  pip install sklearn
  python -m pip install opencv-python
  pip install tqdm
  pip install os
  pip install io
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install seaborn
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install random
  ```
- Import .jpg data from wherever you have this saved.
- Run the code file to obtain the following graphs:
  - Distribution of Brain Tumors
  - Distribution of Types of Brain Tumors
- Use Google Slides to annotate the graphs

- Using `02_brain_tumor_classification.ipynb`, run the remaining code chunks after conducting the exploratory data analysis
  - Balance the data in order to have accurate prediction
  - Split the data into training and testing
  - Use the training data set to build the 3 different CNN models and perform cross validation to find the best SVM model
  - Use the testing data set in order to assess the performance of the 4 models
- Run the code file to obtain the relevant figures.
  - **Heatmaps** (contains heatmaps of the 4 models predicted and theoretical values)
  - **Performance Metrics** (contains tables of different performance metrics like recall, precision, accuracy, etc.)
