# Classifying Tumors In MRI Scans

## Repository Contents
This repository contains all of the necessary files and scripts for classifying 3 types of tumors from 3064 MRI scans. The analysis aims to determine whether different modeling techniques, CNN and SVM , can result in a highly accurate classification.

## 1. Software and Platform

### Programming Languages and Software

### R Packages

### Platform Compatibility
Developed and tested on Mac, but should work on Windows and Linux with appropriate installations.

## 3. Instructions for Reproducing Results

### Stage 1: Data Preparation and Sentiment Analysis in Python
- Download the MRI photo data set from the *link*

  ```r
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  install.packages("dplyr")
  install.packages("kableExtra")
  ```
-
- Run the code file to obtain the relevant figures and models. Since we are using the `kableExtra` package, all figures will only appear when you knit your `.Rmd` file. Knitting to HTML has been found to be the easiest way to do this. The following is an outline of the figures:

  - **Times Series Plots** (contains multiple times series plots to determine stationarity)
  - **Differencing** (contains times series plots of differenced data)
  - **ACF + PACF Plots for ARIMA Model Building** (contains the ACF and PACF plot of transformed data for ARIMA model building)
  - **ARIMA Model Performance** (contains the summarized model performance metrics of the ARIMA models)
  - **ACF + PACF plots + Hypothesis Testing for GARCH Model Building** (contains the ACF and PACF plot of log returns for GARCH model building)
  - **GARCH Model Performance** (contains the summarized model performance metrics of the GARCH models)
- Annotate any figures using Google Slides
