## 3. Instructions for Reproducing Results

### Stage 1: Data Preparation and Sentiment Analysis in Python
- Download the MRI photo data set from the *link*

  ```r
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  install.packages("dplyr")
  install.packages("kableExtra")
  ```
-
- Run the code file to obtain the relevant figures and models. Since we are using the `kableExtra` package, all figures will only appear when you knit your `.Rmd` file. Knitting to HTML has been found to be the easiest way to do this. The following is an outline of the figures:

  - **Times Series Plots** (contains multiple times series plots to determine stationarity)
  - **Differencing** (contains times series plots of differenced data)
  - **ACF + PACF Plots for ARIMA Model Building** (contains the ACF and PACF plot of transformed data for ARIMA model building)
  - **ARIMA Model Performance** (contains the summarized model performance metrics of the ARIMA models)
  - **ACF + PACF plots + Hypothesis Testing for GARCH Model Building** (contains the ACF and PACF plot of log returns for GARCH model building)
  - **GARCH Model Performance** (contains the summarized model performance metrics of the GARCH models)
- Annotate any figures using Google Slides
